# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Conlan, if you're smart enough to stop and read this to try and figure out how to make your react app on your own, follow these steps.

1 make a new folder in documents/Github
2 terminal type npm create vite@latest . //The period is important, space after is not
3 hit react
4 javascript, not with swc
5 delete contents of the div in index html file to start blank
